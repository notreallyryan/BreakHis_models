# Classifying Breast Histopathology Images with Transfer Learning

## Motivation
This project began as a personal challenge. In my final year of my biomedical engineering undergraduate, I took a Coursera course on neural networks. (in hindsight, not the best idea considering I was also taking a full load of classes.)
At the time, I was also trying to figure out what I wanted to do after graduation. I had found the convolutional neural network and image classificaton sections of the course pretty interesting, so I decided to put it to the test in a biological context.
I was primarily inspired by some results that I stumbled across while researching image classification applications in the biomedical field:  


Working over winter break, I put together a rough project comparing transfer learning models that used common image classifier architectures as bases. Unfortunately, I became far too busy to expand on the project, and forgot about it. 
I only seriously started to look at the classifiers I had trained several months after graduation - when I started to consider applying to graduate school.  

By then, two things had changed.
1. After fustrations on another project, I had switched from Tensorflow to Pytorch. As a result I had somewhat forgotten Tensorflow syntax, and wasn't too eager to relearn it for this project. 
2. My hardware had been updated. I had previously used my macbook to train these models. With no dedicated GPU, I had  limited to simple architectures, smaller datasets, and fewer training epochs.
